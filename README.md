# tinkerbox_react

This is a typical React app created using create-react-app script. To start the app: 
1. clone the repo
2. npm install all the dependencies 
3. npm start 

## The purpose of this repo 
1. an skeleton app for prototyping (e.g. proof of concept, mockup UX/Navigation, hackathon, glue things together) 
2. a repo for learning how to mockup by integrating new SaaS (API) solutions 
3. a playground that is more complex than single-purpose codesandbox examples, easier to understand than full-fledged application (most code has not been splitted so you can tweak it before deciding how to decouple components) 


## A few main components 
1. Styling - Material UI 
2. Front-end framework - ReactJS
3. Navigation - material selection, drawer, client-side routing 
4. Authentication and user identities - Auth0 (need account for API key) 
5. Video chat - Twilio (need account for API key) 
6. Rich-text editor - CKEditor 
7. Dynamic tables (export, print, sort, filter, grouping, nest records, etc.) - DevExpress Grid, Material table (you can also try TabulatorJS) 
8. Data visualization (ReChart) 
9. Deployment (AWS amplify) 

## ToDos
1. local db (sqlite) 
2. server side functions (Flask / Node) 
3. Auth using Firebase 
4. Mapbox for map view 
5. Split and comment code for better re-use
